# Vox(el)Met(ric)


It's my fork of the [Voxelmetric](https://github.com/Voxelmetric/Voxelmetric) engine . I am trying to mprove Voxelmetric in my own little way. Some features I am trying to add are improved performance, walking, UI, AI.

Originally developed by [AlexSTV](https://alexstv.com)

## Features

##### Terrain Generation
Generate realistic looking terrain with caves and landmarks like trees.

##### Ambient Occlusion
Darkening in the corners between blocks makes the terrain look more realistically lit.

##### Saving and Loading
Save and load your changes to the world at will.

##### Infinite Terrain
Terrain generates around a given object and is removed when you move too far away, there are no borders or limits.

##### Threading
Threading chunk updates and terrain loading means the voxels take full advantage of your hardware to generate fast without hurting framerate.

##### Define New Block Types
Define new blocks in the scene with your own textures and even your own 3d mesh for the block's geometry.

##### Pathfinding
3d voxel aligned pathfinding for units makes it possible for AI to move around the terrain.

## Development
Vox(el)Met(ric) is in development and is not yet at a 1.0 release, this means things are liable to change fast without notice or be broken and documentation will struggle to keep up.
